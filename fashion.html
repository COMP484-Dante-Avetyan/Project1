        Victorian fashion changed dramatically across the 19th century—silhouettes, textiles, and social meaning.
        This page is formatted like an art history book: plates, captions, and short "reading" sections.

        <h3>Portrait Dress as Evidence (Mid-1860s England)</h3>

        <p class="dropcap">
          Leighton’s portrait is useful here less as a “fashion plate” and more as a snapshot of how an upper-class or
          upper-middle-class sitter wanted to be seen in the mid-1860s: controlled silhouette, expensive fabric, and
          careful restraint. This is the opposite of modern costume styling—no plastic sheen, no exaggerated parody—
          just real tailoring and real cloth reading clearly at a distance.
        </p>

        <h4>What to look for</h4>
        <ul class="book-list">
          <li><strong>Structure first:</strong> even “simple” dresses rely on under-structure and careful bodice shaping for posture and line.</li>
          <li><strong>Surface discipline:</strong> dark, matte fabric and minimal trim can still signal wealth through quality, drape, and fit.</li>
          <li><strong>Context cues:</strong> portrait interiors, flowers, and furnishing choices often reinforce class status as much as clothing does.</li>
          <li><strong>Use on your page:</strong> treat this plate as a “control sample” for real materials + silhouette (not Halloween shorthand).</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="spread-text">
        <h3>Men’s Workwear in the American West</h3>
          Grabill’s “The Cow Boy” is a great reality check. Western clothing in the late 1880s is engineered for riding,
          weather, and abrasion. This is Victorian-era menswear, just shaped by labor instead of city formality.
          </p>

          <h4>What makes it practical (not costume)</h4>
          <ul class="book-list">
            <li><strong>Hat:</strong> broad brim = sun and rain management (a tool, not a prop).</li>
            <li><strong>Trousers:</strong> tough cotton (denim/canvas) or wool. Worn high with suspenders in many work contexts.</li>
            <li><strong>Boots:</strong> built for stirrups and long wear; function comes before polish.</li>
            <li><strong>Layering:</strong> shirt + vest/jacket as needed. Added outer layers for wind, dust, or cold.</li>
            <li><strong>On-horse “kit”:</strong> the saddle carries gear that changes how the outfit reads (bulks, straps, and practical add-ons).</li>
          </ul>

    <section class="book-spread">

        <h3>Textiles, Color, and Decoration</h3>
        <p class="dropcap">
          Everyday Victorian menswear was increasingly standardized: a wool lounge/sack coat (or work jacket), waistcoat, high-collared shirt, and sturdy trousers—often topped with a bowler or cap depending on job and class. The overall look reads “built for weather + work,” not theatrical.
        </p>

        <h4>Key Elements</h4>
        <ul class="book-list">
          <li>Cloth: matte wool (serge/tweed) dominated everyday suits; shiny costume fabrics weren’t the norm.</li>
          <li>Cut: the lounge/sack suit became the common working-man day suit (and spread upward too).</li>
          <li>Class signal: same silhouette across classes, but fit/quality/variety separated them (working men often had fewer outfits).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Silhouette &amp; Structure</h3>
        <p class="dropcap">
          In much of the Slavic countryside, “average” menswear meant layered folk and work clothing. A kosovorotka (traditional peasant shirt) under a caftan outer layer, belted for movement and warmth, paired with practical legwear and rugged footwear for long travel and hard labor.
        </p>

        <h4>Key elements (starter list)</h4>
        <ul class="book-list">
          <li>Kosovorotka: widely associated with Russian peasant everyday wear. The offset collar had a functional explanation (keeps a cross pendant from slipping out during labor).</li>
          <li>Footwear reality: lapti (bast shoes) with portyanki (footwraps) were common in folk dress. Boots appear with means, season, or region.</li>
          <li>Winter logic: shirt and vest + caftan or outer layer is repeatedly described as the practical stack.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>Quick Timeline (you can expand)</h3>
      <ul class="timeline-list">
        <li>
          <span class="year">1830s–1840s</span>
          <br><strong>Men:</strong> frock coats and high-waisted trousers. Tall collars and neckcloths or "cravats".
          <br><strong>Women:</strong> widening skirts, defined waists, dramatic sleeves (especially early 1830s).
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="year">1850s–early 1860s</span>
          <br><strong>Men:</strong> frock coats + waistcoats. More “business-like” day dressing spreads.
          <br><strong>Women:</strong> crinoline era wide skirts. Smooth bodices and structured posture.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="year">late 1860s–1870s</span>
          <br><strong>Men:</strong> lounge/sack suits become common daywear. Bowler hats rise in everyday use.
          <br><strong>Women:</strong> skirts shift backward. Early bustle and trained skirts appear.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="year">1880s</span>
          <br><strong>Men:</strong> three-piece suits everywhere (city). Workwear diverges by job/region (e.g., ranch gear, heavy wool coats).
          <br><strong>Women:</strong> bustle returns and peaks mid-1880s. Sharper contrast between fitted bodice and skirt.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="year">1890s</span>
          <br><strong>Men:</strong> cleaner tailoring lines. Everyday suits feel more “modern,” stiff collars are common.
          <br><strong>Women:</strong> big sleeves early 1890s, then slimmer lines toward 1900.
        </li>
      </ul>
